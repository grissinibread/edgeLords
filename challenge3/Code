#Explanation:
#Going into this problem, my first thought was to obviously find a way to make the fancy words dumbed down enough to
#where its still understandable, and that's what the dictionary does, to assign a unique key to a given key.
#So I went through the test cases and did my best to take all the "fancy" words and made them dumb to make it easier to read.
#After, I did the same thing and went through the sentences again to find common words that are unnecessary, like 'a', 'the'
#things like that. Making the functions, I needed to figure out the python methods to split a string to find certain words, and from there
#make different dictionaries and arrays of strings to show the function what to look for when scanning through the sentences.
#After that it was just a matter of finding more fancy words and deleting the occasional unnecessary word.
