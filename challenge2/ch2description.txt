For challenge 2, our process consisted of finding the best way to determine whether a number was prime. Based on our research, we determined that we should create a function that would eliminate all 0, 1, all multiples of 2 and 3(excluding 2 and 3), and all numbers divisible by any number calculated through 6n +/â€”1 up the original number's square root. By combining these methods we were able to create what we deemed the most thorough and accurate method to ensure a number was prime. After this, we reworked the k = p + 2n^2 equation to isolate the p and be able to check if this resulting p was prime. Our collaboration consisted of brainstorming this process and debugging and improving each other's code until reaching our final product.
